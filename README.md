# Machine-Learning
This repository contains implementations of fundamental supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms built from scratch using Python. These implementations do not rely on high-level machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn but use basic numerical computing libraries such as NumPy for matrix operations.
